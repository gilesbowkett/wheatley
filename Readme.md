Wheatley
========

Wheatley refactors JavaScript semi-automatically.

The project is extremely incomplete.

Claim to Fame

Roadmap
-------

I basically need to refactor the ever-living bejesus out of this mess.

Sibling Project
---------------

Wheatley's sibling project (as yet unnamed) identifies repetitive functions in JavaScript. It runs on Ruby, JavaScript, JSLint, Node, Sibilant, and Redis.

Foundation
----------

Wheatley would be impossible without Johnson.
